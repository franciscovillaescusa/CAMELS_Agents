CAMELS stands for Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations, and it is a collection of more than 15,000 cosmological simulations: 8,925 hydrodynamic simulations and 6,136 N-body simulations. The hydrodynamic simulations in CAMELS can be classified into three different groups:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Generation}. The first/second/third generation follows the evolution of $256^3/512^3/1024^3$ dark matter particles plus $256^3/512^3/1024^3$ initial fluid elements in a periodic cubic box of size $25/50/100~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$.
\item \textbf{Suite}. The simulations can be classified into suites based on the code/model used to run them. CAMELS contains nine different suites:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{IllustrisTNG}. These simulations have been run with the AREPO code employing the IllustrisTNG subgrid physics model. CAMELS contains 4,243 IllustrisTNG simulations.
\item \textbf{SIMBA}. These simulations have been run with the GIZMO code using the SIMBA subgrid physics model. CAMELS contains 1,171 SIMBA simulations.
\item \textbf{Astrid}. These simulations have been run with the MP-Gadget code using the ASTRID subgrid physics model. CAMELS contains 2,080 Astrid simulations.
\item \textbf{Magneticum}. These simulations have been run with the OpenGadget code using the Magneticum subgrid physics model. CAMELS contains 77 Magneticum simulations.
\item \textbf{Swift-EAGLE}. These simulations have been run with the Swift code using the EAGLE subgrid physics model. CAMELS contains 1,052 Swift-EAGLE simulations.
\item \textbf{Ramses}. These simulations have been run with the Ramses code. CAMELS contains 296 Ramses simulations.
\item \textbf{CROCODILE}. These simulations have been run with the Gadget4-Osaka code using the CROCODILE subgrid physics model. CAMELS contains 260 CROCODILE simulations.
\item \textbf{Obsidian}. These simulations have been run with the Gizmo code using the Obsidian subgrid physics model. CAMELS contains 27 Obsidian simulations.
\item \textbf{Enzo}. These simulations have been run with the Enzo code. CAMELS contains 6 Enzo simulations.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Set}. The CAMELS simulations can be classified into six different sets, depending on how the value of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters and the value of the initial random seed are arranged:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{SB}. This set contains at least 128 simulations. Each simulation has a different value of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters, which are arranged in a Sobol sequence with $2^N$ elements, where 
$N$ is an integer number. Besides, each simulation has a different value of the initial random seed. This set is named SBX, where X is the number of dimensions; for instance, the SB28 set of the IllustrisTNG suite. SB stands for Sobol sequence.

\item \textbf{CV}. This set contains 27 simulations. All the simulations share the value of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters (that are set to their fiducial values), and they only differ in the value of their initial conditions random seed. This set is typically used to study the effect of cosmic variance. CV stands for Cosmic Variance.

\item \textbf{1P}. This set contains four simulations per parameter plus one fiducial. In this set, the value of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters in the simulations is varied only one at a time. The value of the random seed used to generate the initial conditions is the same in all simulations. This set is typically used to study the change induced by cosmology and astrophysics in a given quantity. 1P stands for 1-parameter at a time.

\item \textbf{LH}. This set contains 1,000 simulations. Each simulation has a different value of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters, which are arranged in a Latin-hypercube. Each simulation has a different random seed value used to generate the initial conditions. LH stands for Latin-Hypercube.

\item \textbf{EX}. This set contains four simulations. All simulations share the value of the cosmological parameters but differ in the value of the astrophysical parameters. One simulation has fiducial values; the other three represent extreme cases with 1) very efficient AGN feedback, 2) very efficient supernova feedback, and 3) no feedback. All simulations share the value of the initial conditions random seed. This set can be used to study the maximum effect astrophysics can have on a given quantity. EX stands for Extreme.

\item \textbf{BE}. This set contains 27 simulations and is currently available only for the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites. All of these simulations share the exact same initial conditions with the 1P set, and all are run with the fiducial model, but they use different random number sequences for the evolution of the simulation (not to be confused with the random seed that is used to generate the initial conditions). Hence, their differences represent the intrinsic randomness of the simulation results, which can serve as a benchmark for the performance of various predictive models. BE stands for Butterfly Effect.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The initial conditions of all simulations were generated at redshift $z=127$ using 2LPT. For each hydrodynamic simulation, CAMELS contains its N-body counterpart. 

Each simulation produces 91 snapshots, and we saved several of them at different redshifts, including $z=0$. Halos and subhalos are identified using the Friends-of-Friends (FoF), Subfind, Rockstar, AHF, and CAESAR codes. Merger trees are extracted using Sublink and Consistent trees.
